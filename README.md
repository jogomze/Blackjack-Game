# Blackjack Game



Description: This is a simple web application that allows the user to play the classic card game of Blackjack. The game is played against the computer, and the objective is to get a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player is dealt two cards, and can choose to 'hit' to receive additional cards, or 'stand' to keep their current hand. The computer then takes its turn and tries to beat the player's hand. The game ends when either the player or computer's hand value exceeds 21, or both have chosen to stand and the hands are compared to determine the winner.
